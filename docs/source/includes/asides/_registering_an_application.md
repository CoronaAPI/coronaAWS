## Registering an Application

In order to use the TradeGecko API, you must have an active TradeGecko account.
Once you're logged in to your account you can register a new API application at 
[https://go.tradegecko.com/oauth/applications](https://go.tradegecko.com/oauth/applications).

After successfully registering a new application, you will be given a set of 2
unique keys: 

- `APPLICATION ID`
- `APPLICATION SECRET`

<aside class="warning">
  Make sure to keep these keys secret.

These two keys are subsequently used to obtain access tokens for making API calls.
