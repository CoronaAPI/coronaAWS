# Sideloading Resources

TradeGecko allows you retrieve associated resources as part of a single request.
This can be done by adding an `include` parameter containing a comma-separated list of resources to load.

<aside class="notice">
  Sideloading for Orders and Purchase Orders are currently available only when retrieving a single order or purchase order. Using the `include` parameter won't work on index pages.

Here's a few examples:

### Fetching a Bundle Product Variant's Composition

Sideloading parameters for composition API work for both single and collection actions. Examples:

`GET https://api.tradegecko.com/variants/composition/1?include=bundle,component`


```shell
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.tradegecko.com/variants/composition?include=bundle,component
```

```json--inline
{
   "variants": [
      {
         "id": 1,
         "sku": "DRK-0001",
         ...
      },
      {
         "id": 2,
         "sku": "DRINK-PACK-SKU",
         ...
      },
      ...
   ],
   "composition": [
