# Authentication

```shell
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
https://api.tradegecko.com/products?sku=moko/
```

```ruby
require 'gecko-ruby'
gecko = Gecko::Client.new(<CLIENT_ID>, <CLIENT_SECRET>)
gecko.authorize_from_existing(<ACCESS_TOKEN>, nil, nil)
gecko.Product.where(sku: 'moko')
```

The TradeGecko API is JSON based. In order to make an authenticated call to the API, you must include your access token with the call. OAuth2 uses a BEARER token that is passed along in an Authorization header.
